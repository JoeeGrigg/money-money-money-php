Write a program that reads a batch of products and calculates the price with and without tax.

Two PHP Spec classes are provided - the aim is to make these pass.

Create code to calculate the prices with and without tax.

Provide a convenient way for developers to use your code to get the price with or without tax, i.e.:
1. in pence without tax
2. in pounds without tax
3. in pence with tax
4. in pounds with tax

Add the value from the price addition value to the price (once tax has been removed).

Apply the tax rate to the price - this is the percentage value from the tax rate adjustment.

Prices are in pounds.
